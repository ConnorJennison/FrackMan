# FrackMan
Frackman is a 2-D game similar to the popular arcade game Dig Dug. In this game you play the Frackman, whose main goal 
is to navigate through the field and find all of the oil within a level. However, he has to deal with two different kinds
of protestors who will try to impede his progress. In order to deal with them, he can either squirt them with water to 
deplete his life points, or can convince them to leave by dropping gold that can be picked up throughout the level.

This project was assigned in UCLA's CS32 course during Winter Quarter 2016. The project is focused on learning how to organize
a program on a large scale and create several different classes that inheriet traits from each other and organize them in the 
way that makes most sense.
